# Sales-Argentina-Visualization
We used sales and location with 4 different tables from 3 excel files and 1 csv file to determine where to build a logistic distribution hub. Locate sales per month during the year. Analyze most salling products.
1. Clean data- Remove nulls, change text, date, number to the right format, others
2. connect tables
3. Create a bubble graphic where we can find in which city are more sales so it would be better to create a hub.
4. create a bar graph to visualize which product has more sales
5. Create a line graph to visualize sales during the different months
